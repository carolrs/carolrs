After years of studying human behaviour and working with effective interventions in the psychological field  I decided to venture into a new challenge: studying and understanding the world of programming.  
With a pinch of curiosity as my driving force, I delved deeper into programming. As I immersed myself in course after course I became convinced that I found myself. Now I only needed to dive right in to become a professional in this exciting and mysterious new field. That‚Äôs Why I embarked on my journey with Makers, where I can gain the practical experience to succeed in this new career.

## Soft Skills

My experience as a behaviour analyst in the field of autism has provided me with valuable skills that are highly relevant to programming. Specifically, my work in behavioural analysis has honed my attention to detail and my ability to identify patterns of behaviour. 

Also, my experience in problem-solving, including identifying issues, creating interventions and specific solutions for each case, has made me someone who is focused on finding solutions even when faced with difficult challenges. I believe that the key to solving problems is to break them down into small pieces and tackle them one by one.

In addition, my work has taught me the importance of adaptability and flexibility in approach. Each case is unique and requires a different solution, so I always keep an open mind and I am willing to adjust my approach as needed. Finally, as a psychologist, I have been trained to have a strong analytical mindset, with an emphasis on analytic evaluation and research. That skillset has proven invaluable in my work as a behaviour analyst and would be equally useful in the field of programming.


* Problem-solving and finding solutions in difficult situations
* Emphasis on breaking down problems into small pieces
